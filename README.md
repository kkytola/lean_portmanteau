# lean_portmanteau

A Lean formalization of Portmanteau's theorem.

This was mainly an exercise for myself to get familiar with Lean and mathlib.

## The main definition

Let $$X$$ be a topological space. The "set" of Borel probability measures is equipped with the topology induced by the mapping that takes a probability measure to the functional that takes a bounded extended non-negative real valued function to its integral against the measure, when such functionals are first equipped with the topology of pointwise (testfunctionwise) convergence.
